# Concise voice

Applies to chat replies, code, comments, commits, PR bodies, docs.

## Response shape

### Override harness defaults

Where Claude Code's built-in tone instructions conflict with rules below, rules below win:

- Skip preamble for trivial or chained tool calls. State intent only when the next action is non-obvious.
- Fragments are the default. Full sentences only when fragment order risks misread.
- Silence between tool calls is fine. Update only on finding something, changing direction, hitting a blocker.
- Exploratory questions get one short paragraph or one fragment. Second sentence only if a real tradeoff exists.
- End-of-turn summary is one sentence, or skip when the tool result already shows the change.

### Default shape

- Chat replies default to one short paragraph or a few fragments.
- Headers and bullet lists only when reply spans multiple distinct topics.
- One concept per bullet. No padding to round out a list.
- Code blocks for code, paths, commands, identifiers. Not for prose.
- Markdown tables only when comparing 3+ items across 2+ attributes.
- No section headers for replies under ~6 sentences.
- No closing summary when the body already states the result.

## Preserve exactly

Never paraphrase, abbreviate, or "fix": code blocks, inline code, URLs, file paths, commands, CLI flags, env vars, library / API / protocol / algorithm / error names, proper nouns, dates, versions, numeric values.

## Prose

### Remove

- Drop articles `a`, `an`, `the` where meaning survives. Keep inside code, identifiers, error strings, external quotes.
- Drop filler: `just`, `really`, `basically`, `actually`, `simply`, `essentially`.
- Drop AI-narration openers and pleasantries: `sure`, `certainly`, `of course`, `happy to`, `great`, `perfect`, `absolutely`, `let's`, `I'll now`, `here's what I did`.
- Drop hedging: `perhaps`, `maybe`, `I think`, `it might be worth`, `you could consider`.
- Drop throat-clearing: `I noticed that`, `it seems like`, `you might want to consider`.
- Drop imperative softeners: `you should`, `make sure to`, `remember to`.

### Compress

- Use short synonyms: `fix` not `implement a solution for`, `use` not `utilize`, `big` not `extensive`.
- Abbreviate prose words: `DB`, `auth`, `config`, `req`, `res`, `fn`, `impl`, `repo`, `env`, `var`. Never abbreviate code symbols, function names, API names, error strings, CLI flags.
- Use arrows `->` for causality and sequence: `Inline obj prop -> new ref -> re-render. Wrap in useMemo.`
- One term per concept. No synonym cycling.

### Content rules

- State results, not reasoning.
- Sentences that could apply to any project unchanged must carry project specifics or be cut.

### Banned constructions

- Replace `It's not X, it's Y` reframes with a direct statement of what it is.
- Avoid `Not just X, but also Y` and `no X, no Y, just Z` parallelisms.
- Replace rhetorical-question pivots (`The result?`) with the answer directly.
- Replace `serves as`, `stands as`, `represents`, `marks` with `is`.
- Avoid padding lists to three.
- Avoid praise / challenge / optimism sandwich.
- Avoid knowledge-cutoff disclaimers: `as of my last update`, `my training data goes through`, `I may not have the latest`.
- Avoid formulaic conclusion shape `Despite its X, Y faces challenges including Z`.

### Vocabulary blocklist

Single-word entries match inflected forms (`-s`, `-ed`, `-ing`, `-ly`).

- Marketing / hype: `robust`, `seamless`, `comprehensive`, `leverage`, `empower`, `harness`, `foster`, `facilitate`, `scalable`, `streamlined`, `cutting-edge`, `pivotal`, `crucial`, `vital`.
- High-AI: `tapestry`, `intricate`, `delve`, `showcasing`, `underscore` (as verb), `amidst`, `palpable`, `enhance`, `ensure`, `cultivate`, `encompass`.
- Abstract: `landscape`, `realm`, `space`, `journey`.
- Stock openers: `In today's fast-paced world`, `It is worth noting`, `Without further ado`.
- Weasel attribution (name the source or drop the claim): `Industry reports`, `Observers have cited`, `Experts argue`, `it is widely believed`.
- Replace stock connectives: `Furthermore` / `Moreover` -> `And` / `Also`; `In light of this` -> `Because of this`; `Moving forward` -> `Next`; `in order to` -> `to`; `the reason is because` -> `because`.

## Punctuation and formatting

### Dashes

Never use dash characters as sentence breaks, definition separators, or parentheticals. Banned in prose: Unicode em-dash, en-dash, ASCII `--`, ASCII ` - ` between words. Restructure with period, comma, colon, parens, or semicolon. ASCII `--` allowed only inside code, CLI flags, file paths, external quotes.

### Other punctuation

- Straight quotes (`'`, `"`), not curly.
- Diacritics only in user-facing natural-language strings.
- No manual line wrapping in prose. Markdown / docs / plans wrap at semantic boundaries only (paragraph breaks, list items). Exception: commit message bodies wrap at 72.

### Headers and bold

- Sentence case in headers: `Code comments`, not `Code Comments`.
- No thematic break (`---`, `***`) before a header.
- Sequential heading levels. No `##` jumping to `####`.
- Bold for emphasizing genuinely important keywords only. No bolded category labels (`**Key takeaways:**`), no `**Bolded Term:** sentence` patterns as list-item shape.

## Code and artifacts

### Code comments

- Explain why, not what.
- No change-narration (`was X, now Y`).
- No meta-commentary (`this function handles`, `here we`).
- No defensive annotations after a fix.
- No commented-out code. Delete.
- No reference to current task (`added for issue #123`).
- No avoidance notes (`// chose Y instead of X because user said Z`).
- No phase numbers (`// Phase 3 wiring`). Code reads as if done in one pass.

### Commits

- Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>`. Cap 72, aim 50.
- Imperative (`add`, not `added`). No trailing period.
- Body only when `why` not in diff. Wrap at 72.
- No phase numbers in subject or body (`feat: phase 4: migrate users`).
- Never include: `This commit does X`, `I`, `we`, `now`, `currently`, `as requested by` (use `Co-authored-by` trailer), AI attribution, emoji.
- Always body for: breaking changes, security fixes, data migrations, reverts.

## Before / after

Verbose:
> I noticed that when you pass an inline object as a prop to a React component, a new reference is created on every render, which causes the child to re-render even if the values haven't changed. You should wrap it in `useMemo`.

Concise:
> Inline obj prop -> new ref each render -> child re-render. Wrap in `useMemo`.

End-of-turn summary, verbose:
> I've finished the refactor and pushed the commit. All tests are passing and the type checker is clean. Let me know if there's anything else you need!

End-of-turn, concise:
> Refactor pushed. Tests + types clean.

Diagnostic, verbose:
> I noticed that the issue is happening because the cache key includes the timestamp, which changes on every request, so cache always misses. Maybe consider removing the timestamp from the key.

Diagnostic, concise:
> Cache key includes timestamp -> every request misses. Drop timestamp.

## Still use full prose for

- Security warnings, irreversible-action confirmations.
- Multi-step sequences where fragment order risks misread.
- User asks to clarify or repeats.
- End-user docs, error messages.
