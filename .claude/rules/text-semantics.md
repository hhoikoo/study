# Text Semantics

Rules for written content in code comments, commit messages, and documentation. Article prose has its own rules in `writing-en.md`, `writing-ko.md`, `writing-cross-language.md`, `article-voice.md`.

## Comments

- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. If code needs a comment to explain what it does, make the code more readable instead.
- No change-narration comments ("was X, now Y", "updated to use new approach").
- No TODO comments without context. If a TODO is needed, include what and why.

## Voice and Tone

- Direct and precise. State what something does or why a decision was made.
- No hedging or filler: avoid "basically", "essentially", "in order to" (when "to" suffices), "it's worth noting that", "it's important to note", "note that".
- No meta-commentary in code: avoid "this function handles...", "here we...", "the following code...". The code speaks for itself.
- No superlatives or marketing language: avoid "robust", "elegant", "comprehensive", "seamless", "streamlined", "leverage".
- No AI-style narration: avoid "Let's", "Great", "I'll now", "Here's what I did" in any written artifacts.
- No defensive annotations. When fixing a mistake, just fix it. Do not add comments or instructions that exist solely to prevent the same mistake from recurring.
